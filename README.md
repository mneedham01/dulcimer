# dulcimer
# GOAL: 
Tool to generate finger and fret positions for a given chord on the dulcimer, a traditional Appalachian instrument. 
A much-needed resource for dulcimer players in the form of an interactive program. 

# Capabilities: 
- Input the notes of each string (ex. D A A) -> tab for each chord positions
- Challenges: tab needs to be playable (finger position), unique, and make sense within the dulcimer context
